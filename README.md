### Directory organization

IHC/
  - mobile
    - Ihc
      - screens
        - Individual pages of the app
      - components
        - Put any reusable components here
      - services
        - FakeDataService.js: Simulate calls to Express server
        - DataService.js: Hold all calls to fetch()
  - web
    - React code to view admin panel
    - Current directory is very messy, filter out unnecessary stuff
    - Low priority
  - server
    - ExpressJS local server

### Command line

##### Run react native:
1. Start emulator (10 inch tablet)
 
  (Setup instructions here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
    "Building Projects With Native Code" -> Target OS: Android)

  i.e. In my ~/.bashrc I made this function, so I could just call run_emulator 
  ```
  function run_emulator {
      /Users/Matt/Library/Android/sdk/tools/emulator -avd Nexus_10_API_23_Tablet
      # Wherever your emulator is stored
  }
  export -f run_emulator
  ```

2. Run ```react-native run-android``` inside IHC/mobile/Ihc directory

##### Run react native tests:
1. Run ```npm test``` inside IHC/mobile/Ihc

##### Run Express server:

*Inside IHC/server directory

1. After making changes, must build the code (transpile from ES6 to JS). Run
   ```npm run make```
2. Run server by calling ```npm run server```
3. OR to both make and run server, call ```npm start```

4. Start database server with ```npm run db```
5. // TODO: Create a command that spawns a new shell that runs the db (if it
   hasn't been started yet), and then runs npm start

==========================================

### How to...

##### 0. setup the environment

  * This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but hopefully provides a solid
    list of all the steps required
      1. Go to the github page (github.com/matthew-chinn/ihc) and click "Fork" to
         get your own copy on github
      2. From terminal, use ```git clone <your github repo url>``` to get a
         local copy of the repository
      3. Download mongodb (for backend)
      4. Download an Android emulator (i.e. Nexus 10 inch tablet), probably
         through Android Studio (for frontend)
      5. run ```npm install``` in ihc/mobile, ihc/server, and ihc/server/src to
         download dependencies

##### 1. go through coding process
    1. Make code changes
    2. Push code changes to your own Github repository
    3. Click on "New pull request"
    4. I will review pull requests and either merge the changes or reply with
       feedback

##### 2. make a new screen

  *  First of all, distinguish component vs screen:
      - Component is a reusable piece of small UI, aka a common table
      - Screen is akin to single webpage, and the moqup pages almost all represent a
        new screen. In terms of React, a Screen is a component, but the smaller
        reusable components will go in IHC/mobile/Ihc/components instead.
        
  i. Create the screen component in IHC/mobile/Ihc/screens
  
  ii. Register the component in screens/index.js
  
  iii. Can navigate to a screen by doing
  ```javascript
    this.props.navigator.push({
      screen: 'Ihc.<Component name>'
    });
  ```
  
  * For now, wherever you need data from the Express server, make a helper
    function in the services/FakeDataService.js file and create your own sample
    data. Eventually we will use real calls to the server and put that in
    DataService.js

Other options are available: https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/screen-api

##### 3. make a new Express API route

  1. Go to server/src/routes.js and add the route:
     ```javascript
     router.get('/patient/:key', PatientController.GetPatient);
     ```

  2. Add implementation and database interaction in the appropriate
     server/src/controllers file:
     ```javascript
     GetPatient: function(req, res){
       PatientModel.findOne({key: req.params.key}, function(err, patient) {
       if(!patient) {
         err = new Error("Patient with key " + req.params.key + " doesn't exist");
       }
       if(err) {
         res.json({status: false, error: err.message});
         return;
       }
       res.json({status: true, patient: patient});
       });
     }
      ```

  3. Update the README API Section for that route with the expected body and return
     object information (if necessary)

  4. Add tests as explained below
        
##### 4. create automated tests for the server API
  * Helpful resources:      
  * http://www.albertgao.xyz/2017/05/24/how-to-test-expressjs-with-jest-and-supertest/
  * https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/a-tdd-approach-to-building-a-todo-api-using-node-js-and-mongodb
  1. Example:
  ```javascript
    test('/patient/:key should return patient if they exist', () => {
      const model = { firstName: "Test" };

      // Mocking prevents us from having to use the real database. We can
      // simulate the database and return fake, but relatively realistic, values
      // Here, the PatientModel.findOne() method normally passes (error, data)
      // to a callback function, so in this case we pass null for error, and our
      // fake model as the data.
      mock = sinon.mock(PatientModel)
        .expects('findOne').withArgs({key: 'keythatexists'})
        .yields(null, model);

      // Test the API route with the correct route, and expect whatever object
      // should be returned
      return request(app).get('/patient/keythatexists')
        .expect({status: true, patient: model});
    });
  ```


##### 5. manually test the server API
  * Make sure the database server is running (```mongod```)

  1. Run a CURL command like this:
    ```
    curl -d '{"patientInfo": {"firstName": "Brandony"}}' \
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://localhost:8000/signin/newpatient
    ```

  2. Or use Postman (an app that allows you to test server routes in a easier
     way)

  3. Inspect the mongo database (to ensure changes go through properly) 
     with a command sequence such as:
     ```mongo``` to start a database shell, which will allow you to look around
     the db

     ```use ihc``` to switch to the 'ihc' database

     ```db.patients.find()``` to view all of the patients in the database

     ```db.patients.find(<filter>)``` to view patients that meet the specified
     filter. Look up MongoDB documentation for details

##### 6. start the router setup for tablets
  
  1. Connect computer to router with ethernet cable

  2. Start the server with ```npm start``` or ```npm run server```
     and the database with ```npm run db```

  3. Make the computer's IP address a hardcoded value i.e. 192.168.1.100

  4. Update config file for variable SERVER_URL to equal <ip address>:<port>
     i.e. '192.168.1.100:8000' // TODO make config file

##### 7. test React Native code

  1. Use Jest test framework: https://medium.com/react-native-training/learning-to-test-react-native-with-jest-part-1-f782c4e30101
     - 1a. Currently need to alter some code because of dependency annoyances. Go
       to mobile/Ihc/node_modules/realm/lib/extensions.js:260 and ensure the code
       is:

    ```javascript
        if (!realmConstructor.Permissions) {
          Object.defineProperty(realmConstructor, 'Permissions', {
              value: permissionsSchema,
              configurable: false
          });
        }
    ``` 

  2. Use Enzyme to test changing state within components (example included in above link)
  3. Stub methods (such as database calls) with Sinon: http://sinonjs.org/

##### 8. install the app on an emulator/device

  0. If on an emulator, first go to Settings->Apps->Browser->Permissions, and
     enable Storage

  1. Download the .apk file from the Google Drive from your device (i.e. through the
     browser).

  2. Go to Settings->Security->Unknown Sources, and enable installation of apps
     from unknown sources. (Probably want to turn this back off after
     installation is successful).

  3. Go to the Downloads file on the device and click on the .apk file

==========================================

### Overview Use Cases:
Patient gets a new SOAP and Triage form every visit

Medication and growth chart forms reused

Other considerations:
Misc file upload per patient
  - folder to hold scans of anything
Ensure pharmacy can change medications after doctor wrote it in
  - editable table
Timestamp instead of checkbox for patient select for when they finished
  - does this need to persist?
Field for who was triager
Potential password? lock screen after given amount of time?
If router went out, potentailly pass tablets around
  - But wouldnt know patients are signed-in in the first place
  - Maybe have offline patient search

##### High level plan:

Mobile:

- Patients sign in on tablets
- Stations add data for that patient as they go through clinic
- Tablets call API endpoints for local server
  - Store all data received locally in case of router problems
    - Figure out how to update new data efficiently!!!
    - Have a sync button that syncs up all tablets
- Must include Spanish

Laptop:

- Primary need: 
        - Run local server over a local network through router
        - Store all data in local mongo database
- Other use cases:
  (Low priority)
  - View table of all patients and go through data
- Portal for inputting records, probably into Excel and import csv
  
==========================================

### Local server API:

Any :date field should be represented as a string in the form yyyymmdd
When saying _Model, such as PatientModel, it means that the object should
have the same properties as the schema for that Model. It shouldn't be an actual Mongoose
Model object because we will construct that on the backen. If we run into issues
with this level of vagueness, we can specify which properties exactly should be
passed.

router.get('/patient/:key', PatientController.GetPatient);
  ```
  returns: {
    patient: PatientModel
  }
  ```

router.get('/patients', PatientController.GetPatients);
  ```
  returns: {
    patients: [PatientModel]
  }
  ```

router.post('/patient', PatientController.CreatePatient); :white_check_mark:
  ```
  body: {
    patient: PatientModel
  }
  ```

router.patch('/patient/:key', PatientController.UpdatePatient);
  ```
  body: {
    patient: PatientModel
  }
  ```

router.get('/updates/:timestamp', PatientController.GetUpdates);
  ```
  returns: {
    patients: [PatientModel],
    triages: [TriageModel],
    soaps: [SoapModel],
    status: [StatusModel],
    drugUpdates: [DrugUpdateModel],
  }
  ```

router.get('/patient/:key/soap/:date', PatientController.GetSoap);
  ```
  returns: {
    soap: SoapModel
  }
  ```

router.get('/patient/:key/status/:date', PatientController.GetStatus);
  ```
  returns: {
    status: StatusModel
  }
  ```

router.get('/patient/:key/triage/:date', PatientController.GetTriage);
  ```
  returns: {
    triage: TriageModel
  }
  ```

router.get('/patient/:key/drugUpdates', PatientController.GetDrugUpdates);
  ```
  returns: {
    drugUpdates: [DrugUpdateModel]
  }
  ```

router.patch('/patient/:key/soap/:date', PatientController.UpdateSoap);
  ```
  body: {
    soap: SoapModel
  }
  ```

router.patch('/patient/:key/status/:date', PatientController.UpdateStatus);
  ```
  body: {
    status: StatusModel
  }
  ```

router.patch('/patient/:key/triage/:date', PatientController.UpdateTriage);
  ```
  body: {
    triage: TriageModel
  }
  ```

router.patch('/patient/:key/drugUpdates', PatientController.UpdateDrugUpdates);
  ```
  body: {
    drugUpdates: [DrugUpdateModel] 
  }
  ```

==========================================

### Local Storage:

Use Realm as the mobile database

Handling LOCAL STORAGE as backup:
If router goes out...

- Biggest need is viewing old data, they could use paper forms temporarily.
- Needs to be in sync with history and current changes from a previous station

##### Lifecycle:

Beginning:
- Start with all history of previous patients

Signin:
- If new patient, then add to local storage and send to server for others to
grab
- All stuff on patient select page don't store locally
  - including patients that are checked in, which stations they are done with,
    special notes/requests (notes section will not be persistent)

Triage/SOAP:
(Only let one person modify at a time)
- Call server, if it doesn't have a form yet then open blank form
  - If form does exist, render
- On clicking "View Growth Chart", Add weight and height to local storage and
  read local storage to get rest of growth chart data
- If "Save", add to local storage and then send to server

Medication List:
- Display past from local storage
- On "Save", add to local storage and send to server

At end of session:
- Tablets click "Sync and end session" or something
  - Grab all patients with updates later than timestamp
  - (Should base last_updated_timestamps on local device, not the server)
  - Replace patients with new data
 
==========================================

### Mobile Plan/TODO:
React Native

- "Sync" button
  - Locally store updates with AsyncStorage
  - Disable "Sync" if updates exist

-- Begin N/A --

"Upload Updates" PATCH /groups/:group/all -> Express API:
Send list of local updates
Locally save list of timestamps when "Upload Updates" was clicked
Body:
  {
    timestamp: When "Upload Updates" button is clicked,
    userUpdates: list of user updates
        [{ <Match user object in database design section> }]
  }

"Sync" GET /groups/:group/all/:timestamp?exclude=[timestamps] -> Express API:
Pass in 
  :timestamp of when last synced
  [timestamps] 
    - Timestamps when "Upload Updates" was clicked to exclude from results to
      avoid duplicates

Retrieve list of all updates since given timestamp (last synced)
  - Go through list and locally save updates
  - Clear local list of "Upload Updates" timestamps

-- End N/A --


==========================================

### Laptop Plan/TODO:
React and Express local server

TODO
- Form to manually add new information (?)

-- Begin N/A --

Routes:
  ESSENTIAL:
  
  GET   /groups/:group/all/:timestamp   => Return information for updates after
                                           last_synced_timestamp
    1. Grab list of send_update_timestamps from groups/:groupid
    2. For each send_update_timestamp that is later than the last_synced_timestamp
      ("Last synced" is property of the tablet)
      - Ignore timestamps passed in to exclude param 
      - Get list of updates from groups/:timestamp and consolidate into one list

  PATCH /groups/:group/all   => Update information for all people
    - Body contains 
    {
      timestamp: send_update_timestamps,
      user_updates: list of user updates
    }

  NONESSENTIAL:
  GET   /groups/:group/:id   => Return information for that person
  POST  /groups/:group      => Add information for new person
  PATCH /groups/:group/:id   => Update information for person

-- End N/A --

==========================================

### Realm Database design:

The schema for the local storage Realm database is defined in mobile/Ihc/models.

### Mongo Database design:

The schema for the server's Mongo database is defined in server/src/models.
